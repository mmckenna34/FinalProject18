# Intro to Programming Final Project - Fall 2018
# This is a Choose Your Own Adventure game. There are many different paths you can take, and there are only a few ways to "win" the game. There are dozens of endings in which you do not win the game, which greatly increases the replay value. In addition, your actions affect what paths you can take and which ones you cannot. I used a variety of methods that we learned throughout the year to create this code. I did not use any sources and all of my code is original. It is a fairly simple game but I think it is pretty fun
